# METU Ray

METU Ray (MRay) - GPU-Based Renderer/Renderer Framework.

MRay is a ray tracing based renderer framework for researching computer graphics techniques. It is designed to be extensible for comparing different rendering methods, material (BxDF) sampling and ray accelerators. Although after hardware accelerated ray-tracing, the accelerator portion probably is not necessary.

## Features

- It is completely GPU-based for rapid rendering and proposal development
-

## Limitations

- Implemented using CUDA; thus, only CUDA-capable GPUs are supported. This means only NVIDIA cards.
