Dear GRSI Reviewer,

The entire codebase is quite large and has many dependencies. Most of the dependencies
are statically compiled and available in the repository.

Since GRSI[1] requires the code to be worked on a fresh install some dependencies needs to be downloaded manually.

The instructions below are for a Windows 11 Operating System.

HW requirements:
 - An NVIDIA GPU (GTX1XXX series or newer)
 - OpenGL capable hardware (can be the NVIDIA GPU or on-board integrated GPU)

These include (Please download via these links):
*CUDA*:
https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/12.3.0/network_installers/cuda_12.3.0_windows_network.exe

*NVIDIA OptiX*:
https://developer.nvidia.com/optix/downloads/7.6.0/win64

*Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 Community*: (Latest version should compile the codebase)
https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=Community&channel=Release&version=VS2022&source=VSLandingPage&cid=2030&passive=false
- Visual studio should be installed with MSVC C++ compiler.

*Python*:
https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.12.3/python-3.12.3-amd64.exe
- Pyhton scripts are available in the repository

Since the operating system is Windows, all these installations require human interaction; thus we are unable to include these on the script.
Just install the


Sincerely,
Bora
